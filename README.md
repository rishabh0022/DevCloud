# DevCloud - Cloud-Based Code Editor

DevCloud is an innovative cloud-based online code editor designed to support multiple programming languages. It allows developers to write, test, and execute their code directly in the browser with real-time collaboration and seamless cloud infrastructure. The project is built with a focus on scalability, reliability, and performance using modern technologies.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Write and run code in several programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple developers can collaborate on the same codebase simultaneously.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Scalable architecture powered by Kubernetes (K8s) to handle growing user demands.
- **Containerized Development**: Leveraging Docker to create isolated environments for different programming languages and tools.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly web interface for editing, running, and sharing code.

## Tech Stack

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Container orchestration to manage the deployment and scaling of services.
- **Node.js**: Backend server to handle the application logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, simplifying route management and API integration.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time, bidirectional event-based communication for enabling live collaboration.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development environments and easy deployment.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend development for building a responsive web interface.

## Architecture

The system is designed around a scalable architecture powered by Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized applications. Docker is used to package the backend services, while Socket.io facilitates real-time communication between users for live collaboration. The cloud infrastructure ensures high availability and efficient management of resources.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Node.js (v14 or above)
- NPM (or Yarn)

### Step-by-step guide

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devcloud.git
   cd devcloud

2. **Set up Docker containers:**

Build the Docker images for the project:

```bash

docker-compose up --build
Run Kubernetes setup:

3.**Deploy the application on Kubernetes:**

```bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
Access the application:

Once the application is deployed on Kubernetes, you can access it via a web browser.

If you're using minikube for local Kubernetes clusters, run the following command to expose the app and access it:

```bash
Copy code
minikube service devcloud-service
This will open the browser with the DevCloud editor.

For cloud-based Kubernetes environments (like AWS EKS, GKE, or Azure AKS), ensure that the service is exposed to an external IP and navigate to the provided URL to access the DevCloud editor.
